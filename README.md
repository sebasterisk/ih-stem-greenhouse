# The Ignatian Honors STEM Greenhouse Project
The code in this repository was used in the Ignatian Honors STEM Greenhouse Project 2024-2025. 
This project entailed creating automated subsystems for greenhouse functions such as 
lighting, climate, and security using the Arduino platform.

Thanks to Mr. Pierce and Mr. Bromwell for providing the resources necessary for this project.

Credit is also due to the following people for providing their team's code:
